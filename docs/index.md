## Overview 

We performed deep mutational scans to measure the impact on DPP4 binding of all single amino-acid mutations in the MERS and PDF-2180 CoV RBDs, and compare mutational effects to those in the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD background.

Here, we link to an interactive visualization that enables exploration of the data from these deep mutational scans across SARS_CoV-2 variants.


### Instructions 

We have made two tools to help visualize the data from our deep mutational scans:

1. A set of interactive heatmaps that you can use to explore the change in ACE2-binding affinity ($$\Delta$$log10 $$K_D$$) or the change in RBD expression (log10(MFI)) caused by mutations in each RBD variant. To use this tool, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link heatmaps.md %}).

### Data

If you are interested in the raw data from our study, you can find the DPP4-binding affinity (-log10 $$K_D$$) and RBD expression (log10(MFI)) measurements from each experiment [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/MERS-PDF2180-RBD_DMS/tree/main/results/final_variant_scores).
